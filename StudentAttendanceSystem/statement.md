Student Attendance System

This project provides a minimal, CSV-backed attendance tracker. It includes:
- Student and Attendance models
- Repository classes that read/write CSV files
- Services to manipulate data and generate a report
- A simple console UI (`MainMenu`) to interact with the system

The files are intentionally simple and suitable as a starter template for expansion.
